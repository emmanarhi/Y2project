# Course project for CS-A1121 (Basics for Programming Y2)
This program is a simple turn-based strategy game with three playable characters and three enemies controlled by a simple artificial intelligence. The game has two maps configured from a text file but also a course editor where the user can make their own map. There are three kinds of obstacles; trees, water and lava.
NOTE: The only library needed outside of the python standard library is PyQt6
# How to use it?
Run the 'main.py' file located in the 'src' folder. Quit the program at any time by pressing 'Q'. Upon starting, the main menu will appear, offering options to play pre-made maps or create a custom one using the editor. Use the editor to modify square types, and start the game by pressing 'S'.

During the game, select a character using the left mouse button. On your turn, choose to move, attack, or heal. Move your character with the arrow keys, attack enemies by clicking on them (and selecting the attack type), and heal by using the right mouse button.
